IntelliJ allowed me to open the project, however, when I built/ran the project it couldn't locate the class any more because it was transforming the file path to remove the special character and therefore was looking in the wrong directory.
To solve the problem, I just removed the special character from the folder name my project was stored in and reopened the project in IntelliJ.

A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of several sentences. There are usually between three and eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to see when one paragraph ends and another begins.

In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay.

Paragraphs may signal when the writer changes topics. Each paragraph may have a number of sentences, depending on the topic.
