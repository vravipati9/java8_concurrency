interfaces can not have state

four rules of defaulut methods
1	you get what is in the base interface
2	you may override default method
3	If a method is there in the class hierarchy then it takes precedence
4	if there is no method on any of the classes in the hierarchy, but two of your interfaces
	that you implements has the default method
	to solve this use ruel 3.	

// Method reference can be used only when you receive something and passing that value without modification
