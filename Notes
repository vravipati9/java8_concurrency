interfaces can not have state

four rules of defaulut methods
1	you get what is in the base interface
2	you may override default method
3	If a method is there in the class hierarchy then it takes precedence
4	if there is no method on any of the classes in the hierarchy, but two of your interfaces
	that you implements has the default method
	to solve this use ruel 3.	

// Method reference can be used only when you receive something and passing that value without modification

Q) When can we use Parallel streams
If we have collection of data and needs to perform similar operation and order doesn't matter, we can use Parallel streams

// Functional Interfaces
Runnable
Callable
Consumer
Supplier
Functional

Closable interface in java?

Method vs Function
------------------
Methods which belongs to classes
Function: a lambda expression is an anonymous function, it doesn't have a name but it just a piece of code
it has some statements or expressions

Q) When can we use Parallel streams
If we have collection of data and needs to perform similar operation and order doesn't matter, we can use Parallel streams
